With 13 teams on board, the event turned out to be a power-packed one. <br/><br/>The quiz touched upon all the spheres which are related to Navratri, be it the general knowledge, the history, or the mythology behind Navratri. For an added touch, some of the questions had audios as well as images through which participants had to guess the correct answer. I think no stones were left unturned in order to make this quiz an engaging one, it was almost as if all of us were together on the campus competing, playing, and having a fun time celebrating everyone's favorite festival.",

The event began with a quick warm up session to prepare the participants for the coming energetic choreography. Once everyone settled in with the Garba vibe, the ever awaited dance of the evening was started.<br/><br/>Members of both clubs coordinated to step-wise demonstrate the whole choreography to the song \"Rangtaari\" from the film \"Loveyatri\". As mesmerising the song was, the steps taught to the participants did much justice with the added grace. Each and every step was repeated at least once to make sure the audience was keeping up with the rhythm. All the doubts were resolved timely and it was a lot of fun to learn Garba online with friends from our very homes.<br/><br/>The evening wonderfully came to an end with freestyle Garba on the traditional Gujarati \"Dakhla\". Everyone truly enjoyed the event throughout, the entire session was interactive and it was appreciated how Garba could connect the students of PDPU even through a screen.",
